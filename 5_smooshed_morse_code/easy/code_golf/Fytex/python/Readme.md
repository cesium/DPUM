How this works? Each letter a-z represents two digits from the main string. If we get the binary representation of that number, removing the first digit (1), it matches the morse code for the letter. I added 1 at first so 001 wont be the same as 01 because we will make 001 -> 1001. (001 = 1, 0001 = 1 too...)
There is a photo next to this file for u to understand it better.
